# Creadit Card Project
 
 In the banking business, credit score cards are a frequent risk control approach. It
predicts the likelihood of future defaults and credit card borrowings based on personal
information and data provided by credit card applicants. The bank has the authority to decide
whether or not to offer the applicant a credit card. Credit scores can be used to objectively
measure the severity of a risk. Our purpose is to distinguish multiple factors that influence the
probability of overdue payments, to categorize ‘good’ and ‘bad’ clients for future credit card
approvals
